# PhantasmicRNG
A high school game assignment created to fully complete the games development course.


# Instructions:

before running the game in a text editor its necessary to download 2 python modules for it to function correctly that being pygame and colorama 
to install these modules you will need to install pip and run the following commands in a terminal: "pip install pygame" and "pip install colorama" (without quotations).
Its preferable to run this game under visual studio code, however any typical text edior will suffice just as long it can run correctly. 

# Notice: 

I have yet to find a way to keep the ascii art in their orignal state without stretching it out when running on a monitor with a insufficient screen size if you ever do run into this problem
this may be the cause.
